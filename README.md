# Golinks Assessment

Create an API Endpoint to retrieve a sorted list of the top commit authors from a Github Organization. The requirements are left vague on purpose to see your creative ability to architect a solution here. Use any language you are comfortable with, but make sure to include instructions on how to get your endpoint up and running.
